    <p style="text-align: center;"> When i first met you on genshin, i had no idea i was gonna this attached. I could feel myself slowly falling in love with you. There is no reason. I just like you because you are you. 
        <br> I know i'm annoying, weird and cringy? but I love to love you. I wish i was able to explain how wonderful you are to me but, i can't because you have me loss words.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"> It's okay if you don't feel the same. I just want you to know that you are loved. I hope things get simpler for you. 
        <br> Spend your days with easy breaths and soft words. May you have a wonderful life with no worries</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"> p.s. i'm not finished falling in love with you yet. hehe. Thank you for existing<3</p>
